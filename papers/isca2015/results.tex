\subsection{Distributed Flash Access Performance}
Latency for local flash reads, reads from local DRAM, remote reads over
fpga/serial, remote reads over serial/host DRAM, remote reads over
ethernet/Flash ethernet/DRAM

Measure latency of 8K page reads + filtering 

Aggregate bandwidth for flash, collecting all flash to one node, flash to pcie?
Aggregate bandwidth for competing workloads on multiple servers \(scalability\)
