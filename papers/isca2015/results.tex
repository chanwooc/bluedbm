\section{Results}
\subsection{Configurations}

\subsection{Distributed Flash Access Performance}
Latency for local flash reads, reads from local DRAM, remote reads over
fpga/serial, remote reads over serial/host DRAM, remote reads over
ethernet/Flash ethernet/DRAM

Aggregate bandwidth for flash, collecting all flash to one node, flash to pcie?

Aggregate bandwidth for competing workloads on multiple servers \(scalability\)

\subsection{Distributed Analytics Performance}

Measure latency of 8K page reads + filtering for flash, host DRAM, remote flash,
remote host DRAM, remote host DRAM with sw filtering
