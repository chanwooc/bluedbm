\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the design and implementation of FlashBoost, a distributed
flash-based Big Data analytics platform. High-performance processing of large
datasets often depend on fitting the entire working set in the aggregate DRAM
capacity of a processing cluster, and creating a large enough cluster often
becomes prohibitively expensive.  FlashBoost aims to accelerate access of very
large datasets by storing all data in a cluster of flash storage and providing a
dedicated storage network between storage devices. FlashBoost also aims to
accelerate data processing by incorporating compuation capabilities in the form
of accelerators in the resulting storage device with a combined storage/network
interface, maximizing the use of storage and network performance and
parallelizing computation across accelerators.  We argue that a small cluster of
FlashBoost nodes with sufficient flash storage can be a viable, less costly
alternative to a much larger traditional DRAM-based cluster.
