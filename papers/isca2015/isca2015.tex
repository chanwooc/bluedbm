\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the design and implementation of FlashBoost, a distributed
flash-based Big Data analytics platform. High-performance processing of large
datasets often depend on fitting the entire working set in the aggregate DRAM
capacity of a processing cluster, and creating a large enough cluster often
becomes prohibitively expensive. Flash storage is orders of magnitudes cheaper
than DRAM and consumes less power while being orders of magnitues faster than
disk storage, but its performance is constrained because it has been used as a
drop-in replacement to disk, despite its different characteristics.  FlashBoost
aims to accelerate access of very large datasets by storing all in a cluster of
flash storage and constructing a flash-optimized architecture. This include an
integrated storage network between storage devices, and in-store processing to
offload computation and reduce data transfer over the host-side link.  We argue
that a small cluster of FlashBoost nodes with sufficient flash storage can be a
viable, less costly alternative to a much larger traditional DRAM-based cluster.
