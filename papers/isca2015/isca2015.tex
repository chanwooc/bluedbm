\begin{abstract}
Big Data analytics have been shown to provide deep insights which are both
commercially valuable and socially impactful. Complex data queries, because of
their need for random accesses, have proven to be slow unless all the data can
be accommodated in DRAM. There are many domains, such as genomics, geological
data and daily twitter feeds where the datasets are 5 to 20 TB. A cluster with a
total DRAM capacity of 10 TB may easily cost (dollar) 300K and consume 30
Kilowatts of power. In this paper we present FlashBoost, a rack-level
flash-based system which is significantly cheaper, and has an order of magnitude
smaller power and area footprint. A node in a FlashBoost appliance consists of a
server, a flash storage device capable of in-store processing, and an integrated
network between the storage devices. We present the rationale underlying
FlashBoost and show that it outperforms a rack-level cluster with SSDs. For many
applications, FlashBoost provides an attractive alternative to large clusters in
terms of price-performance tradeoff.
