\subsection{Nearest Neighbor Search}

Figure~\ref{fig:result_hamming} shows the performance of nearest-neighbor search
with various data sources, normalized to the in-storage processing performance.
We compared FlashBoost against a high-cost fully DRAM configuration, as well as
realistic systems where some data cannot fit in DRAM.
Table~\ref{tab:nearest_neighbor} describes the benchmarks depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:result_hamming}.

It should be noted that we have throttled our flash storage throughput to
600MB/s for this experiment, which is the bandwidth of the SATA 3.0
specification. This is to compare only the benefits of the in-store processing
architecture against other designs, otherwise the high bandwidth of the
FlashBoost hardware will result in an unfair comparison. When using all of the
2.4GB/s of our flash bandwidth, FlashBoost with ISP outperforms DRAM up to 4 threads.

\begin{tabular}{l | p{0.25\paperwidth}}
\label{tab:nearest_neighbor}
Name & Description \\
\hline \hline
DRAM & Store all data in DRAM \\
ISP & Process data in in-storage accelerator \\
FlashBoost+SW & Use FlashBoost as raw storage \\
Seq Flash & All requests are sequential flash accesses \\
10\% Flash & Store most data in DRAM. 10\% chance of hitting flash \\
5\% Disk & Store most data in DRAM. 5\% chance of hitting disk \\
Full Flash & All requests go to flash \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

It can be seen that streaming data directly from DRAM is obviously the fastest, and
scales linearly with thread count because it becomes a computation-bound
workload. The configuration that uses an in-storage processor to offload
computation is consistently faster than the software implementation, because
there is no software overhead involved, and the in-storage processor can process
the data at wire speed. Since sequential flash access outperforms FlashBoost
with two threads, it can be seen that this performance difference is not because
of the flash device performance but because of architectural differences and
software overhead.

Using the full bandwidth of the storage system would
have made this gap even more pronounced, as the software's bandwidth would be
limited by the PCIe running at 1.6GB/s. It can be seen that when even most of
the data can fit in DRAM, even rare access into storage can have a significant
impact on performance. These results further reinforces our claim that better
storage systems are required for effective analytics of very large datasets.

Figure~\ref{fig:result_hammingfull} shows the performance of un-throttled
FlashBoost, compared to a DRAM implementation. A single node of FlashBoost
outperforms DRAM up to 4 threads, and two nodes outperform DRAM up to 16
threads.

\subsection{Graph Traversal}

Figure~\ref{fig:result_graph} shows the performance of the graph traversal
accelerator, compared to a software implementation that accesses remote nodes
over a separate network. It can be seen that the low latency access to flash
becomes beneficial.




\subsection{Hardware-Accelerate String Search}

We compared our implementation of hardware-accelerated string search running on
FlashBoost to the Linux Grep utility querying for exact string matches running
on both SSD and hard disk. Processing bandwidth and server CPU utilizations are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:result_strstr}. We observe that the parallel MP
engines in FlashBoost are able to process a search at 1.1GB/s, which is 92\% of
the maximum sequential bandwidth a single flash board. Using FlashBoost, the
query consumes almost no CPU cycles on the host server since the query is
entirely offloaded and only the location of matched strings are returned, which
we assume is a tiny fraction of the file (0.01\% is used in our experiments).
This is 7.5x faster than software string search (Grep) on hard disks, which is
I/O bound by disk bandwidth and consumes 13\% CPU. On SSD, software string
search remains I/O bound by the storage device, but CPU utilization increases
significantly to 65\% even for this type of simple streaming compare operation.
This high utilization is problematic because string search is often only a small portion 
of more complex analytic queries that can quickly become compute bound.  As we
have shown in the results, FlashBoost can effectively alleviate this by
offloading search to the in-store processor thereby freeing up the server CPU
for other tasks.
