wjun:

These files were copied from
$BLUESPECDIR/board_support/bluenoc/xilinx/VC707/verilog/ddr3_v2_0/ddr3_v2_0/user_design/rtl/

and the directory structure flattened.
This was done only to reduce the number of --verilog flags in the connectal makefile.

P.S.
vc707_ddr3.xdc is also copied over from the connectal/xilinx/constraints directory, just in case it goes missing in later versions
